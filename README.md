# Turbulence
 A study in webcam tracking for Creative Programming II, written in p5.js.

## So what does this do?

  The computer tracks your video and calculates the flow of motion in your video with set "zones". That motion then affects the particles that are generated on screen. (the flow zone code was adapted to p5.js by Jeff Thompson. Thanks Jeff!).

  This project was inspired by how wind maps are generated, and though it does not quite look like a wind map (there were some technical limitations), it is still a pretty fun little program!
