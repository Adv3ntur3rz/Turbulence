# Turbulence
 A study in webcam tracking for Creative Programming II

## So what does this do?

  The computer tracks your video and calculates the flow of motion in your video with set "zones". That motion then affects the particles that are generated on screen.

  This project was inspired by how wind maps are generated, and though it does not quite look like a wind map (there were some technical limitations), it is still a pretty fun little program!
